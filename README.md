# 555_LED_Blink

This is a basic electronics project that shows the basic use of a 555 Timer IC in a simple circuit that blinks an LED.

There is a Fritzing design file and exports from it that include a schematic view, breadboard view, and pcb layout view.

## Schematic

## Breadboard

## PCB Layout

## Purpose

The reason I put this together was for a contest I will be running at the Security BSides DFW conference.
The contest is a solder challenge where contestants must solder together this circuit in working condition in the fastest time.
